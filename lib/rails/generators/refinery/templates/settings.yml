# RefinerySettings Configuration File.  Loads these settings on app startup.
#
# File is formatted as:
#
# scoping:
#   setting_name:
#     value: foo
#     destroyable: *optional* 
#     ...
#   setting2_name:
#     value: foo
#     destroyable: *optional* 
#     ...
#  
#  For "unscoping-ed" settings, use this as the scoping:
#  unscoped:
#    unscoped_setting_name:
#      ...
#    unscoped_setting_name_2:
